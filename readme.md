## Local development
First clone `@nrk/core-components` and install its dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nrkno/core-components.git
cd core-components
npm install # Installs dependencies for all packages
npm start # Your browser will open documentation with hot reloading
```


## Testing

Before running tests you need a `.env` file providing credentials to Browserstack:

```sh
BROWSERSTACK_USER=...
BROWSERSTACK_KEY=...
```

Save it in the root directory. Now you can either run the tests locally:

```sh
npm test
```
or remotely against all targeted browsers:

```sh
npm run test-remote
```

## Building and committing
After having applied changes, remember to build before pushing the changes upstream.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-changes
# update the source code
npm run build # Builds all the packages
git commit -am "Add my changes"
git push origin feature/my-changes
# then make a PR to the master branch,
# and assign another developer to review your code
```

## Publishing

```bash
npm run publish:minor -- --core-input --core-toggle # Specify packages to publish
```

> NOTE! Please also make sure to keep commits small and clean (that the commit message actually refers to the updated files).
> Stylistically, make sure the commit message is **Capitalized** and **starts with a verb in the present tense** (for example `Add minification support`).
